The present repository contains a mini CRUD project using the FastApi python framework.

the crud is focused on user management.
the system will store all the users in memory, no database is used, because it is intended to demonstrate the operation of a CRUD. however the file in charge of controlling the storage of users in memory; storage.py can be replaced by a database connector and thus, make the system work.

the system validates the user's schema, validates that the email is unique, validates the format of the date of birth and validates the age.
